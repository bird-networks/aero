Aero is a safe, declarative, developer-friendly, innovative interception web
proxy with many features. Aero provides full site support without delay and has
a clean, organized codebase. Aero is made to bypass filter restrictions, web
restrictions, and bypasses web browser restrictions.

You can refer to the [docs website](https://aero.sh/docs) if you are looking for
instructions for how to get aero or how to work on aero

## I just want to use aero

## What is a web proxy?

Web proxies are website libraries that work to emulate the functionality of the
site that you want. They do this by intercepting API calls and rewriting
documents to emulate as if it was under the proxied origin.

Web Proxies can be used for:

- Bypassing **any** browsing restrictions in a sandbox
- Unblocking websites or **browser features** through emulation
- Middleware

## Subprojects

### AeroSandbox

AeroSandbox contains all of the Sandboxing code for aero and is entirely
independent of the rest of aero's source (aero's SW depends on it), so you can
use it outside of aero. Remember, AeroSandbox is not just for proxies.

### ProxyParse

A collection of parsing libraries that are specifically optimized for anything
you would possibly need in a proxy. It is currently only for JS, but expect a
HTML parser soon!

It is highly recommended that you install
[aero middleware](https://github.com/vortexdeveloperlabs/proxy-middleware) for
enhanced functionality.
