# aero's unit tests

Aero should never be published to NPM or this code merged to `main` from
`unstable` if any of the unit tests fail.

The tests will be processed in this order

1. Node tests
1. Package
1. Dev-server headless
1. Browser (AeroSandbox) tests ...

## CI

All of these will have integrations with Github Actions except for the
[wpt-diff](../WPT-Diff/README.md) tests
