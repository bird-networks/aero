/**
 * @module
 * This module is for formatting errors in a consistent way.
 * There is one of these for aero and one for AeroSandbox both in their `...shared/` folders.
 * This is because they may have different default feature flags.
 * This is similar to the one in `$shared/fmtErr.ts,` but since this is a test file, the feature flags aren't built into a bundle, so they must be passed in, which is why this file is different.
