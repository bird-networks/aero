# WPT-Diff tests

What is the point of making your own test cases for every Web API interceptor
that your proxy uses. The entire point of a unit test is to feed sample data
into a method (in our case WebAPIs). You can write them for each of the APIs
that you support, but then you have to factor in if the Web API is supported in
the web browser that you are trying to write the tests for. The best thing you
can do is run the WPT tests in a headless browser and serialize the all of the
passes into a varaible and then do the same thing, but instead of routing the
browser to the real location of the web test, put the URL under your web proxy.
All you have to do now is get all of the tests passed without a proxy, but not
passed under the proxy. This will tell you exactly which APIs don't work under
your proxy.

I recommend sorting the APIs that don't work by APIs that don't work because of
a flawed API interceptor and those that are broken probably because the proxy
doesn't support that API. Specifically, when I make my implementation I will use
all of the `APIInterceptor` exports to collect all of the property paths after
the global object (the name of the object on which the API is defined), which
would be a list of all APIs that are supported in aero. I will use this list to
distinguish between both types.

WPT-Diff is a far greater method of gauging site support rather than testing
random sites, because there are obscure APIs you probably wouldn't reach
otherwise, and you get an actual answer instead of having to debug the execution
of an entire site for a non-obvious answer.

## How to run WPT-Diff on your own proxy

### Through the CLI

`npx wpt-diff --package=@aero/wpt_diff`

### Through CI (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
uses: vortexdl/aero/actions/wpt_diff@untested
```
