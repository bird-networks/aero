# TODOs

- Use the types for the service worker specifically in this `aeroSWAdditions`
  folder and nowhere else in `AeroSandbox`

## Specific additions

- Implement the backend in `self.fetchEventMiddleware` needed for
  `<controlview>.loadURL`. Internally when that method is called, it will send a
  message to the child (iFrame) and the child will redirect to the proxy
  location URL. Instead of it redirecting to `/go/<ENCODED PROXY? URL>`, it will
  have be an addition to the original prefix on the SW. Let's say the SW's
  prefix was `/go/`, loadURL would redirect the iframe's location to
  `/go/<ADDITIONAL PREFIX>/<ENCODED? PROXY URL>`. This is how it would know to
  add on the data in the query params. What this middleware will do is overwrite
  `event.request.url` to remove the additional prefix and modify the headers
  accordingly to the passed in params.
